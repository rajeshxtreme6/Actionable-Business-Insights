Problem Statement:

In the fast-paced corporate landscape, deriving actionable insights from vast datasets is a challenge. Jatan Shah, a Certified Microsoft Excel and Power BI Trainer, addresses this challenge through a trans formative 2-day workshop. Attendees not only enhance their Excel skills but also delve into the art of creating powerful Power BI dashboards using extensive datasets from a successful business.

Insightful Dashboard Creation:

1. Click on the card visual to add it on canvas. Once added, drag a numerical sales field that want to visualize in the fields box.

2. Click on the table visual to add it on canvas. Once added, drag Customer Name, Sales, Cost and Profit int the field that want to visualize in the columns box.

3. Creating a Column Chart – X-axis & Y-axis

i. Sales is Y-axis - Adding numerical metric as Y-axis helps the user understand the extent of it by the column height.

ii. Category and Sub-Category is X-axis - Added the text based field that want to see in the X-axis. As we are using a column chart, numerical metrics like sales, profit etc will become Y-axis as we want the column HEIGHT to show the extent of that metric.

4. Creating a Column Chart – Legend

Legend's - further divides your visual into different colors by adding a second level of breakdown.

Adding Region to legend breaks all our subcategories from 1 column for each subcategory to 3 columns for each sub-category, all having different colors.

For example – 1 Column of bookcases becomes 3 columns of Bookcases from Central,

Bookcases from North & Bookcases from South.

5. Creating a Column Chart – Tooltips

Any metric (numerical field) that you add in Tooltips will be visible to you when you hover over different elements of the visual.

For example – After adding Profit to tooltips, whenever user hovers over ANY column of the column chart, they will see profit of that subcategory along with the Sales amount as well. Profit amount will only be visible as a value in the hover box and

not as an additional column in the chart.

6. Creating a Bar Chart from a Column Chart

To create a Bar Chart, all you have to do is create a Column Chart & then click on Bar Chart icon in Visualization Pane to convert it to a Bar Chart.

7. Creating a Line Chart

To create a Line Chart, all you have to do is add your date field in X-axis & the numerical field you want to see the trend of in Y-axis.

Note: By doing the above you will get one line showing trend of the numerical field over your date range. If you want to break it into multiple lines based on another field, such as Shipping Mode, add it to the legend as shown below.

8. Creating a Pie Chart

To create a Pie Chart, add your numerical field in values & the field by which you want to see a breakdown of your values in legend.

Note: By doing the above you will get one line showing trend of the numerical field over your date range. If you want to break it into multiple lines based on another field, such as Shipping Mode, add it to the legend as shown below.

Fine-Tuning and Conclusion:

Once the visuals are in place, the next steps involve meticulous alignment, background color adjustment, font changes, and size measurements. These refinements elevate the aesthetics of the dashboard, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
